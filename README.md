# koa-demo
A demo/sandbox for the koa framework


## To Run

ES6 is required for koa, so make sure a supporting version of node is installed

- `$ npm install -g n` (or any node version tool)
- `$ n 0.11.13` (at the time of writing)

Run the server with the `--harmony` flag to allow ES6 functionality

- `$ node --harmony app`
